				<p><b>Hi, I’m Isabel Anguera!</b> I am a Design and Technology, and Culture and Media Studies major at The New School in New York. I was born in Lima, Peru and have moved around from place to place most of my life. Having done so, and getting to live in Lima to Portugal to Lynchburg, Virginia, I have always been fascinated by different cultures and the people that have helped shape my view of the world. I find that personal connections and life experiences fuel my designs and my understanding of people and our environment. In terms of work, currently I am unemployed lol. I am actively seeking job or internship opportunities in UX/UI design, and actively learning about the skills I will need to do the best work I can in the future. </p>
