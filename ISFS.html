				<h2> The Project </h2>
			</div>
			<div id = "column">
				<p> Instruction Sets for Strangers was a four week long project in which we had to choose a location in New York City and create three site-specific interventions that would encourage interaction without written or verbal instructions. </p>

					 	<h3> When? </h3>
					 		<p id = "answer"> We got to the park on a Sunday when it opened at 7:30 am so as to be as unintrusive as possible. </p>
					 	<h3> Where? </h3>
					 		<p id = "answer"> We set up in the upper portion of the park where it was predominantly older people playing cards or board games. </p>

			<h2> Interactions </h2>

				 		<p id = "answer">We painted boxes to make building blocks for kids. We also brought a ball that they could use to knock them all down.</p>
				 	<h3> Why? </h3>
				 		<p id = "answer"> We decided that kids would be more willing to interact with anything we placed in the park. The older people seemed content with their routine.</p>

			<h2> Interactions </h2>
			<p id = "interaction"> The kids swarmed around us as we set them down and played with them for over two hours straight, building with them, knocking them over, throwing them at each other, and eventually when they opened up, they would crawl into them. They avoided the ball for the most part.</p>

			<h2> Interactions </h2>
			<p id = "interaction"> When we set up the blocks this time, the kids were a bit older and more violent. They were unsure at first about whether or not they were allowed to touch the boxes, but then started interacting with them. They opted to flip the boxes on top of each other trying to form a structure, and then they decided to try and destroy them. They threw them on the ground, at each other, and hit them with bats. There was one younger girl who, with the help of her mom, started building a structure in the way we intended.</p>

			<p id = "interaction"> This project went through a few drastic variations, which were influenced by our first intervention and the user testing that happened as we observed it. We noticed that our target audinece would be fairly tough to influence in terms of breaking their routines. Because we changed to the younger kids we ended up getting more interaction, and being able to document the vast differences. </p>
