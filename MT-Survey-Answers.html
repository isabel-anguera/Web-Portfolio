			<h2>What do you think the future of communication looks like?</h2>
			<div id = "answer-box">
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Advanced</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I think communication will be done for a major part through electronic devices.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>One common language</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I think we'll end up with a device implanted in us that gives us the intelligence to know other languages.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Telepathy</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Robotics</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>More tech</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Increased use of technology, reduced face to face interaction</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I think it’s moving towards less interactions in person and more online or via phone</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I foresee less languages and the world moving towards one global language as the world becomes more connected. I also think symbols will be used more, such as emojis. Smaller dialects will slowly fade.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Extremely antisocial</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I believe that there will be different levels of communication, one level will be basic and universal, another will be similar to what we have now but even more filtered which will perpetuate group think..marketing and labeling, using our personal private information will play a large factor. My hope is that there will be a push for more fact based, critical thoughtfulness to what exists now and a platform that promotes that.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Decentralized like crypto</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Lots more techonogucal in conjuction with less corporal contact</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>The internet</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>All with the use of new technology</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Good</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Not that much different from today's.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div id = "question">
			<h2>What do you think about the possibility of a universal language? What do you think it would look and sound like?</h2>
			<div id = "answer-box">
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Neutral</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>They have tried this before and it failed, so I don’t think it would work in the future. I think English would be the closest thing we have to a universal language, so it would be really similar with maybe some Chinese or spanish in there as well.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I think it will be English, because it is already the most common language when communicating internationally.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I feel like there wouldn't be another "established universal language" in the future. I feel like it would include something with body language.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>English would probably be it</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I think it’ll ruin cultures</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Potentially a mix of English Spanish and manderin, would be useful but doubt it’s achievable</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Its been tried: Esperanto was a neat idea, but it failed reasonably spectacularly. As is, due to the internet, english is becoming the lingua franca pretty much worldwide.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I can’t really see that happening, although it’s an interesting thought. Most countries value their language as part of their culture.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I think the universal language will be one that already exists such as English or Chinese. I think every country or area of the world will have its own accent and slang but a completely new language won’t become a universal language.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I would not like the idea of a universal language. People would lose their identity. If there were a universal language I think it would be telepathic</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I think it will be emoji-like, it will be basic and could be great for signage, transportation, basic things. My fear is that it will be a version of the state run language from the novel 1984.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Hard for me to see based on historical facts. Operating systems are adapting to every region/language</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I dont necessarily agree with it but i think the english language has become sort of the universal language</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Im not sure</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>it would be like a device that can detect any language and translate it to you to be able to communicate with someone with a different language fluidly</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Fantastic</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Would be awesome, but will probably not be used for at least another century; too much national pride and tribal behavior still around. Will probably look a lot like one of the much-used languages right now (English is a strong contender). Conlangs have failed so far, mostly due to very limited people knowing them and nobody growing up with them.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div id = "question">
			<h2>Is there anything unique about your own communication habits? Slang, weird words you use?</h2>
			<div id = "answer-box">
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Nothing</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I don’t have much of an accent, even though I normally should have because of where I come from. This is because my parents are both teachers and are adamant on talking properly. I do use some words typical for my region, eg I ask “which?” instead of “what?”, people from other regions find this quite weird</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>No, I don't think so</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I think when I speak korean, there's definitely a different set of slang vs when i speak english. The tones are different.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yea being from many places my slang is always changing...also If Im close to someone and they use a particular dialect I usually copy it</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>yes i use lots of slang particularly when i text</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Not really</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I have a tendency to pick up slang from books I read. A Clockwork Orange took a couple months to work its way out of my speaking patterns.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I tend to use weird Irish phrases or words since I grew up in Ireland. For example, they put everything in the negative. If someone asks me how I’m doing, I would answer “no, no I’m fine.” Meaning I’m fine haha!</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Not anything super unique, but I use a lot of sarcasm.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I try to Taylor my communications to the right crowd and base it off of different situations. I use some slang in order to customize my delivery.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I am very demonstrative when I speak. My face is a language unto it’s own.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Short and more and more non verbal</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Growing up in NYC, there are definitely a good amount of slang incorporated into my everday dialogue</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I use lots of slang</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>yeah I tend to use slang or even made up sayings that make sense to mye</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>No</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I almost exclusively communicate in English, despite being Dutch and living in the Netherlands. Helps to have international coworkers and friends.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div id = "question">
			<h2>Do you speak another language? Why?</h2>
			<div id = "answer-box">
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Farsi</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I speak Dutch, English, French and German. These are the languages we are taught in school in Belgium because they are our official languages</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I am learning German, since I am currently living here.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes, my parents are from another country.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>French & because I took it in high school</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>yes i speak persian because my parents were born there and speak the language</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>No</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>A bit of German(family), and some Spanish(work)</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Irish and French. I was required to take Irish classes from the age of 5 till college. Even though the language isn’t spoken in Ireland, it’s important to the Irish to keep the culture alive. We were also required to learn another language while in high school (most likely because Irish I completely useless). We had a choice of French or German. I always thought it was odd Spanish wasn’t an option!</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Spanish because my dad is from Spain and I lived in Spanish speaking countries.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes. My parents are from different countries.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes, we are a multi-cultural family and have lived in six countries.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Borne in Spain</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I speak 5 and i have my parents to thank for that</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I speak another language at home that my father was raised with.</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>yes i speak spanish to speak to my family in Mexico and El Salvador</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Spanish a little. I like different languages</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes. Most people here learn Dutch (native), English, German and French by default, at the very least to a basic level. I've also picked up some basic Spanish.</p>

		<div id = "question">
			<h2>Have you ever heard the term "Machine Translation?" Do you know what it is?</h2>
					<img src = "Imgs/survey-chart.png">
		</div>
		<div id = "question">
			<h2>Machine translation is a technology, more specifically software, that allows us to translate source text, written or verbal, into target languages—basically, think Google Translate. Does this change your view of what the future of communication might look like?</h2>
			<div id = "answer-box">
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Maybe</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>This will definitely aid us in communicating to people with different languages, since that can be a barrier sometimes. Although it needs to work better than what google translate is right now.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes, I have had to use this technology a lot, living in a foreign country.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Of course. People travel and live in countries where the language is a heavy barrier.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>It could</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes it does</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Seems not ideal for face to face</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>It is a stopgap measure, and inherently tends to remove colors of meaning.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Not really.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Not really. It is more like a stepping stone into a universal language.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I think it will connect the world.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>My fear is that it might be translated by a third party, a corporation, a government, with its own agenda. Example: Catholic Church translating the Bible for centuries to the illiterate, changing it to serve their own purposes. Or, Muslim Imans, translating the Koran to millions who do not know Arabic. Their translation can be very subjective serve their own agenda.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>No, it will work for programming but not for social interaction</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Nope</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yeah</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>No. There's a lot of cultural and subtle side meaning stuff which is almost impossible to translate. Let alone humor, sarcasm or seductive communications. A lot of interpretations and translations require extensive knowledge of the background (and implicit assumptions) of both the source and the target language. Tom Scott did an awesome video on this (youtube).</p>

		<div id = "question">
			<h2>Are you optimistic about the future of communication? Why or why not?</h2>
			<div id = "answer-box">
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Maybe</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes, we are in an age of globalisation and learning other languages is getting more important. This will help in getting to know cultures all around the world, and understanding each other better which will definitely benefit society overall.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Not as much, because I feel like countries don't prioritize that since there is already an established language(s) in their countries.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes I think we will be able to communicate with many ppl soon all as one which is neat</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes as i think we are continually evolving</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I think it will be the same</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes. It can't exactly get worse.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Not really. I don’t like that we are moving away from the in person interactions. People are going to become so lonely!</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes I am because better communication usually producers better results. If we can all communicate properly and effectively, then we should be more effective as a group.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I am not. I think we really communicate less and less every day.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Unless their is a consumer bill of rights and codes of ethics in the transmission of information, I worry.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Neutral</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>No because of what i said in my first answer</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes, technology makes it easier to communicate through barriers.</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes because I feel like we can really be able to access new parts of the world and get to actually talk to those in places we could dream of visiting</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes easier</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>The future of communication, sure, why not. The reason and subject of the communication, and the future state of humanity, a lot less optimistic.</p>
				</div>

			<h2>Are you optimistic about the future of technology? Why or why not?</h2>
			<div id = "answer-box">
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Maybe</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes and no. Technology can be an amazing facilitator if it is used correctly and ethically.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes, I think it is getting easier to talk to people from different cultures as well as learn about things on the go</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Nah because tech will destroy us all ...tech is getting pretty crazy</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes as technology is continually updating</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Not really</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Reasonably. it i uncommon for tech to get worse.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes, but it’s also scary how advanced we are getting</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes but also scared. It is moving fast. it could be used in ways that it wasn’t meant to be used in and cause harm.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I am as long as we use it for the right reasons.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>There needs to be a code of ethical norms.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Very optimistic but I really don’t understand well enough the impact that I’ll make in my lifetime.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>No because as much as it is meant to connect people it does the opposite</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes and no, technology has power.</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes because it can really aid us</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Same here. Technology is nice, and it will probably get nicer still. But it's a tool, and as such not as important as what we use it for. Humanity is in a lot of trouble right now.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div id = "question">
			<h2>How do you think technology will influence communication as it advances?</h2>
			<div id = "answer-box">
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Maybe</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>It can provide a platform to contact someone anywhere in the world and translate the words. However it will not replace real human contact</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I am sure it will. I see it already with emojis and gifs.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I think it might allow us to understand and empathize better</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I think it will help communication but also make it dangerous like if we have chips and can use telepathy that’s dangerous communication</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>most people are currently using technology to communicate so i think this will continue in the future</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>A lot</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Improved language learning, while simultaneouslyreducing the need as translators get "good enough".</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Hopefully it will make it easier for people of other languages to communicate.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>It will make communication faster, more effective, and easier. People that previously couldn’t communicate with others will now have a new channel to communicate. It will make the world more connected.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>I think it will isolate people more and more</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Look above.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>More personalize with the need for filters that protect privacy and thruth</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id = "answer">
					<p>First answer</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>It will continue to become more socially dominant online.</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Yes</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Bring community’s together</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "answer">
					<p>Higher bandwidth and central databases and servers will improve the number of things we can share with others. Not sure if it's a good thing. It will also make us much more vulnerable to the greed of capitalism, which cares not for communication or technology or humanity, but only for money.</p>
