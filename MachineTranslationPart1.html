			<h3>What is Machine Translation?</h3>
			<p> Machine Translation is <b>fully automated software that allows for the translation of one source, written or verbal, into different target languages.</b> There are a lot of approaches to getting this to happen, including: Ruled-based, statistical, Example, based, hybrid, and neural machine translation. There are softwares, most popularly Google Translate, that function well now, but none are as accurate as needed for more serious applications.</p>
