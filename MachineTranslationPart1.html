					<p> In order to explore and critically envision how technology may impact our world, I looked into the technology and future of machine translation software. In order to learn more about this emerging technology I researched the topic as a whole, then focused in on a more specific area of the technology: Word Sense Disambiguation. From there I did a 2d study, and 3d study about machine translation.  </p>

			<h2>What is Machine Translation?</h2>
			<p> Machine Translation is <b>fully automated software that allows for the translation of one source, written or verbal, into different target languages.</b> There are a lot of approaches to getting this to happen, including: Ruled-based, statistical, Example, based, hybrid, and neural machine translation. There are softwares, most popularly Google Translate, that function well now, but none are as accurate as needed for more serious applications.</p>

			<h2>2d Study</h2>
			<p>Thinking of a 2d object I could make about machien translation was tougher for me than I thought it would be. I had just done a lot of research about how the software works, the algorithms that are used, etc. I was thinking about how machine translation could be applied to society rather than a way in which I could represent that in a 2d way. I decided then to look into the future, to a point where machine translation is fluent or almost there. I took inspiration from a few places, one of them being a story about a 2020 Democratic Primary candidate who learned to speak Norwiegan in order to read a book by a Norwiegan author which had not been translated. The story made me think about how there is so much knowledge all over the world, so many experts who have so much to share, and some of them might not have the ability to share it, or more likely, people might not have the ability to hear about it. I thought it might be interesting to make posters for a fake lecture series hosted by the United Nations that used machine translation in order to make the information being shared by the lecturers available to anyone with an internet connection--no language barriers.</p>

					<h2 style = "text-align: center">Problems</h2>
					<p>I initially struggled to think about a way to translate the topic into a 2d object. I had done so much research on its mechanics that my head had a tough time turning the information I had into a 2d application. </p>

				<div id = "column" style = "flex: 20%">
					<h2 style = "text-align: center">Changes</h2>
					<p> In my first drafts I didn't include actual lecturers on the posters. I added them in after feedback, and focused the lecturers more in terms of a topic-language experts. I also added a website and the date. Obviously lack of concept made me focus more on the aesthetics of it all. </p>

				<div id = "column" style = "flex: 20%">
					<h2 style = "text-align: center">Lessons</h2>
					<p>Learning to balance concept with aesthetics, changing concepts if need be, don't force anything if it's not there, pivoting from analytical thinking to conceptual, big picture ideas/applications.</p>

			<h2>3d Study</h2>
			<p>In terms of my 3d study, I created a card game. While I would say I took inspiration from Apples to Apples, Cards Against Humanity, and the MetaGame, this definitely does not do any of those justice and lacks concept. Now that I've sold it to you I'll explain the rules. There are two kinds of cards: Topic Cards, and Likeness Cards. Both types have words in different languages on them, and a vague sentence in which you could use that word to provide context. The only difference between the two types of cards is the fact that the topic cards have some sort of relationship to a few of the likeness cards. To play, each player is dealt 5 Likeness cards and a topic card is turned over and shown in the middle. Each player must try to figure out what they think the topic card might mean from the context clues and do the same with all of their likeness cards. They should play the card in their deck that they think is most related to the topic card and must defend it to all of the players. Together they must decide who wins, but this can be done by also checking what the words mean (written in a tiny font upside down on each card). Although there are some good aspects to the game, the concept could be greatly improved, so it is currently a work in progress.</p>

				<p id = "rules-header"><b>How to play:</b></p>
				
				<p style = "padding:0 4% 0 4%; margin-bottom:2%"><b>Setup:</b> Each player gets dealt 5 Likeness cards. One person, who will also play each round, is in charge of the Topic cards.</p>
				
				<p style = "padding:0 4% 0 4%; margin-bottom:2%"><b>Gameplay:</b> Each round, a Topic card is placed in the middle of the group—the card will be either in English or in a language you might not understand—the goal is to read the context sentence below the topic word and try to put a Likeness card from your hand that relates to the Topic word in some way. Place it facedown in the middle, and then flip over when everyone has played their card. You must then defend your word, even if you don’t know what it means. </p>

				<p style = "padding:0 4% 4% 4%; margin-bottom:2%"><b>Winning the Game:</b> The winner of each round gets to keep their Topic card, so the winner is whoever has the most Topic cards when the game is over, which can be at the end of however many rounds you’d like to play. </p>
			</div>

			<div id = "row">
				<div id = "column" style = "flex: 20%">
					<h2 style = "text-align: center">Problems</h2>
					<p>The concept of the game is lacking. There is barely a difference between the topic cards and the likeness cards in terms of content and its presentation, which is something that could be improved upon. There is also so much more that can be done with the topic of machine translation and how it relates to the format of the game.</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "column" style = "flex: 20%">
					<h2 style = "text-align: center">Potential</h2>
					<p> I believe that there are potential versions of the game that could be interesting. There could be versions in which the words are all one language and could be used as a method for learning it. There could also be a version in which the topic cards are all one language, or a version in which the idea of word sense disambiguation is exaggerated through words that could be used in the same context.</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "column" style = "flex: 20%">
					<h2 style = "text-align: center">Lessons</h2>
					<p>Thinking through the rules of the game completely before starting to design it. Once again balancing concept with aesthetics, using research in a way that helps your design and concept. Get as much user testing as you can and allow time to think about how you can improve every aspect of what you're working on.  </p>

			<h2>Takeaways</h2>
			<p>Machine translation has a lot of powerful prospects. With its advancement we open the world up to one another. This could lead to great or terrible things; it all depends on how we approach it, how we implement it, and who has power over it. Doing this initial research and creating both studies gave me insight into what machine translation software could mean for us and for communication in our society. This is only the beginning of my look into machine translation as what I have found is that there is so much potential within the topic. It's implementation suggests huge questions that I look forward to exploring in <a href ="MachineTranslationPart2.html"><b>Emerging Futures Part II.</b></a></p>
