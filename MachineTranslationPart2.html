			<h2> My Thoughts and Ramblings </h2>
			
			<p>Machine translation isn't a technology that is going to alter our bodies, change our genes, or let us choose the way our children look—it's going to affect the way in which we communicate. How it will do that is a simple enough question to answer—it will allow us to communicate with basically anyone who has access to the software, but this means more than being able to have a conversation with someone in Berlin, Oslo, or Hanoi without knowing a word of German, Norwegian, or Vietnamese; it means that we are opening up the world to each other. Think about the interconnectedness that could be created, think about the possible division, about movements, good or bad that could be organized. These things brings into question power dynamics and the role that languages actually do play in our society today. We won't know though what this means for the future until it becomes our present, so I thought I would create a conversation about these thoughts that I couldn't get out of my head through short experiments, surveys, and interviews to try and gauge how people perceive our social future with the advancement of Machine Translation technology. </p>

			<h2> The Tower of Babel Story </h2>
			
			<img src = "Imgs/tower-of-babel.png" style = "width: 75%; margin-left: 30%">

			
			<p>“The Tower of Babel is an origin myth meant to explain why the world's peoples speak different languages. According to the story, a united human race in the generations following the Great Flood, speaking a single language and migrating westward, comes to the land of Shinar. There they agree to build a city and a tower tall enough to reach heaven. God, observing their city and tower, confounds their speech so that they can no longer understand each other, and scatters them around the world.” <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel">(wikipedia)</a></p>
			
			<div id = "genesis-quote">
				<h3>Genesis 11:1-9</h3>
				
				<p><b>1</b> And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. <b>2</b> And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. <b>3</b> And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. <b>4</b> And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. <b>5</b> And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. <b>6</b> And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. <b>7</b> Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. <b>8</b> So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. <b>9</b> Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>

			<h3>How This Relates to Machine Translation</h3>

			<p>The incorporation of a fluid machine translation software into our future society could allow for what is equivalent to a united language in The Tower of Babel story. Without language barriers we are opening up communication pathways and expanding the reach of our voices throughout the world. Movements can be aggrandized, for good or for bad. In the story, God basically decides that a united man is too powerful and scatters them. By also taking the power of communication away from them, collaboration is further complicated, and language is highlighted as a powerful tool. Machine translation is a path to a united language and possibly to a united man, which can lead to amazing or terrible things. </p>

			<h2>Experiment #1: Universal Language</h2>

			<p>Two people will be tasked with creating their own method of communicating with each other. They can change the rules of a language they share (English), but none of the words can have their original meaning. When they think they have their ‘language' figured out, I will give each of them notecards with common phrases on them. They will take turns trying to communicate those phrases to the other person using their newly created form of communication. Most of the phrases will be common, like "my name is ____" or "hello, how are you today?", however the last phrase for each of them will be about protest or rebellion. An example might be, "Are you going to the climate change protest later?" The participants will know that they will be tested on their language, and will likely plan for the common phrases, however we will see if they take into account more serious topics. When the test is done I will ask them how the experience was and how they think this could tie into machine translation or a universal language. How power dynamics might come into play and who would play a part in the formation of a universal language. </p>

					<h3>What I Expected to Happen</h3>

					<p>As I planned out this little experiment I thought that I would have the participants create a whole new language with a structure and everything, but I quickly realized that this would be unrealistic. After discarding the idea I figured that the new way of communicating would involve using synonymous or opposing words for what is on the card. I expected certain words to be difficult for them, like protest or climate change. </p>
				</div>

				<div id = "column">
					<h3>What Actually Happened</h3>

					<p>As I figured, Liana and Jessica decided to change the meaning of each word to it opposite. If they meant “I” they were saying “You,” if they meant “Love” they said “Hate,” etc. For verbs and personal pronouns this method worked well, however for nouns like “Thanksgiving” or “Protest” it was more difficult. This is when the visual portion of the language came into play, where they acted the words out. It was surprisingly successful, even though it took a while for them to figure out their phrases, and the fact that they cheated in quite a few ways.  </p>

			<h2>George Orwell's <i>1984</i></h2>

			<img src = "Imgs/1984.png">

			<p>“Newspeak is the official language of Oceania, scheduled for official adoption around 2050, and designed to make the ideological premises of Ingsoc (Newspeak for English Socialism, the Party's official political alignment) the only expressible doctrine. Newspeak is engineered to remove even the possibility of rebellious thoughts—the words by which such thoughts might be articulated have been eliminated from the language. Newspeak contains no negative terms. For example, the only way to express the meaning of “bad” is through the word “ungood.” Something extremely bad is called “doubleplus ungood. The particularities of Newspeak make it impossible to translate most older English (oldspeak) texts into the language; the introduction of the Declaration of Independence, for instance, can be translated only into a single word: crimethink.” <a href = "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/section11/">(Sparknotes)</a></p>

			<div id = "genesis-quote">
				<p>Newspeak's grammar is arranged so that any word can serve as any part of speech, and there are three different groups of vocabulary words. The A vocabulary contains everyday words and phrases, as Orwell says, “for such things as eating, drinking, working” and so on. In comparison with modern English, these words are fewer in number but more rigid in meaning. <b>Newspeak leaves no room for nuance, or for degrees of meaning.</b> The B vocabulary of Newspeak contains all words with political or ideological significance, specially tailored to engender blind acceptance of the Party's doctrines. For example, “goodthink” means roughly the same thing as “orthodoxy.” <b>The B vocabulary consists entirely of compound words and often compresses words into smaller forms to achieve conceptual simplicity:</b> the English phrase “Thought Police,” for instance, is compressed into “thinkpol”; “the Ministry of Love” becomes “miniluv.” The C vocabulary encompasses words that relate specifically to science and to technical fields and disciplines. <b>It is designed to ensure that technical knowledge remains segmented among many fields, so that no one individual can gain access to too much knowledge.</b> In fact, there is no word for “science”; as Orwell writes, “Ingsoc” covers any meaning that such a concept could possibly have.</p>

			<h3> How This Relates to Machine Translation</h3>

			<p>Imagine a world in which we communicate through translators; whether they are implants, if we can use them when we want, or if they're our sole mode of communicating with one another. In any of these situations, machine translation software is a prominent part of our social exchange. This would likely mean that whenever we speak, what we say would go through a third party software before reaching the person we are speaking to. What if this software were to be controlled by a country's government, or the United Nations? How would censorship come into play? What if it were controlled by a company like Facebook? There is a lot of power to be had with managing machine translation software. With that much power comes great responsibility and great temptation. Distorting people's words, censoring them, erasing them, it's a real possibility. George Orwell's Newspeak is a dystopian idea with the potential of becoming reality if we don't approach the incorporation of machine translation with awareness of the effects it could have on society. </p>

			<h2>Experiment #2: Third party</h2>
			<p>Two people will sit across from each other and have a conversation using a third party translator: me. They will both have headphones on, and as one relays what they want to say to me, the other will play music loudly so as to not hear the information themselves. Their goal will be to plan some sort of outing or event that they will go to in the future. Their conversation will require them to establish a place, a date, a time, who is invited etc. I, as the translator will relay their messages to each other however I choose, since I have the power and they have no idea how I am choosing to transmit their words. At the end they will say out loud what they think the plan is. </p>

					<h3>What I Expected to Happen</h3>

					<p>As the translator I thought that they would see right through me when I told them the wrong information and that I would change the plans up just slightly rather than completely. I thought that they would ask each other questions like a normal text conversation. I thought that the plans that they made with each other would be similar but different enough to where the information changed would be detrimental to their plans. </p>
				</div>

				<div id = "column">
					<h3>What Actually Happened</h3>

					<p>As the translator, although I felt like they didn't believe what I was saying was accurate, they never doubted me because I never gave them any real reason to.  They fully trusted me, which was surprising. I ended up changing their plans drastically, which was unexpected but came about because of the way the conversation flowed. Rather than them planning something together, one of the participants, Jessica, took charge and lead the conversation, which forced me to come up with ways in which I could alter the plan as a whole rather than just relay incorrect information. Instead of a back and forth style conversation where someone asks when they want to meet, it was an invitation to an event that was already planned. </p>

			<h2> An Interview</h2>

			<p>I wanted to get input on other people's thoughts about Machine Translation and the future of communication. </p>

			<div id = "transcript">
				<p><b>Me: Okay, so what do you think the future of communication looks like?</b></p>

				<p>Liana: I think the future of communication is basically technology.I think most of our communication will be done through technology. We've already been seeing a little bit of that now, currently, but I feel like in the future it will be really dominated by technology. </p>

				<p><b>Me: Have you ever heard the term Machine Translation?</b></p>

				<p>Liana: No, I have not.</p>

				<p><b>Me: So, that's kind of what you're saying in the sense that machine translation is software that can take source text, written or verbal, and translate it into any target language basically. So do you think that would come into play in communication in the future. </b></p>

				<p>Liana: Yeah I do, I know there is this technology that: if someone has the device and is speaking a different language, and if you also have a device it'll switch it from the language they're speaking, into the language that you understand. So, it is communication, technically it is human communication, but it's done through technology. So I feel like yeah, we are starting to see a little bit of that now and I feel like if that does take off that will dominate the technology world and change the way we communicate with other people. </p>

				<p><b>Me: So the idea of a universal language that's spoken by all has come to be a theory of what might come out of machine translation. Do you think that would be possible? Is it a viable result?</b></p>

				<p>Liana: Well, it's definitely something that could happen, but it all just depends…We have to look at who is creating this universal language. Are they involving, because if it's going to be a universal language, are they involving everyone in developing this language? Are they involving at least a representative from each country? How is it going to get done, and who's going to be the dominant person in charge? Or are we not going to have a person in charge? I feel like it just, there are so many things it depends on that it's--It just depends on a lot of things, so I don't know if it would be able to work, but maybe.</p>

				<p><b>Me: So you think that a universal language would have to be created rather than it would evolve to become a universal language from our…</b></p>

				<p>Liana: I mean if it's going to evolve.. Like what do you mean? evolve and take languages from all parts of the world?</p>

				<p><b>Me: So eventually they're saying that we would start speaking all the same language. So some people say that Chinese might become the universal language, or English. </b></p>

				<p>Liana: Oh, so a language that already exists?</p>

				<p><b>Me: Not necessarily, it's still kind of a very abstract idea.</b></p>

				<p>Liana: Yeah, I mean it is poss--I mean Chinese is like--I don't know I feel like that could happen. I feel like some of the top two or three languages in the world. Overtime people might start speaking them but I don't know. I don't know. </p>

				<p><b>Me: So imagine we did have a universal language. Do you think that slang or accents or geographic location in general would play into it at all?</b></p>

				<p>Liana: Yeah I feel like even if there was a universal language everyone would speak it differently. Because on a much smaller scale, people from LA have terms or words that people in New York don't say. We can still understand each other perfectly fine but there are little words here and there that people use for different things. So I feel like on a bigger scale, creating a whole new language and have different people literally all around the world, not just coast to coast speaking it, I feel like it's bound to change and to adapt into the language they spoke before and where they live. </p>

				<p><b>Me: So going back to a point you made about someone having control over the languages that we speak, do you think that if we did end up speaking through translation software--do you think there's an ethics issue there in terms of who is really translating it, who has control over what is being said?</b></p>

				<p>Liana: Yeah, I feel like it's going to be a tricky one because anyone that has that much power, unfortunately, in my opinion is bound to get corrupt. It's bound to get… Even if it starts off as a good thing, I feel like that person might end up using it for personal gain however that's possible. I don't know, I definitely feel there's an ethics problem there because letting one person have that much power, especially a universal power, not just power over a continent, state or a country, but a universal power, that's a lot. That's a lot to have and that might... I don't know if we can trust one person with it. I mean who is to say we can even trust a group of people with it. </p>

				<p><b>Me: Changing topics here, how do you think that mass media and machine translation could be related in how they affect the way we communicate with one another?</b></p>

				<p>Liana: Well they've already started affecting how we communicate with each other now. Like for example, a minuscule example is talking on the phone. It technically is human interaction even though it's being done through the vessel of a phone and just commenting on someone's instagram. Yeah you're communicating with them, you're communicating to a human but you're also doing it through a device, so I feel like it's already started incorporating itself into our society now, and I feel like in the future it's going to take off and completely dominate the way we talk to one another. </p>

				<p><b>Me: Nice, do you think that fluent machine translation will have an effect on your life personally?</b></p>

				<p>Liana: Yeah I do because every time technology advances I think it affects all of our lives, even in aspects we don't realize. It's definitely going to be an important thing in my life because I'll be living through it. I'll be living in a time period where technology like that is just happening so it's going to be everywhere. So yeah, I feel like it will affect my life. </p>

				<p><b>Me: Nice, well thank you!</b></p>

			<h2> A Survey</h2>

			<p style = "background-color: #D4ECFC; padding:2% 4%">I wanted to find out even more about what people thought, so I sent out a survey on Reddit forums and Facebook groups with nine questions about the future of communication, the future of technology, and how they might be related. I ended up getting 18 responses, a lot of which were really interesting and led me to different avenues that I could pursue. Click <b><a href = "MT-Survey-Answers.html">here</a></b> to see what people had to say! </p>

			<h2>A Manifesto</h2>

			<p><b><a href = "MT-Manifesto.html">This</a></b> is a manifesto I wrote about how to approach the integration of Machine Translation and what is at stake. Be aware that it is a bit dooms-day-ish, but it's written as a caution more than anything :)</p>
		</div>

		<div id = "section" style = "margin-top: 12%">
			<h2> Takeaways</h2>

			<p>Technologies like Machine Translation can completely change aspects of our lives and society. A technology that could affect the way we communicate has the potential to be super powerful and bring tons of good into the world. We, however, need to approach it knowing the power that it brings. This project was fun for me to work on because it allowed me to think about all the possibilities and potential situations that could stem from one thing. It seemed like conversations all around me had to do with communication, with how to distinguish meaning, etc. I loved talking about it with other people and hearing or reading their thoughts on the subject. Althought I think I look at this technology throughout the project with a dooms-day outlook, I really think that machine translation could do more good than bad. I think that it will unite people in a way we don't even expect, in a way that we won't notice until we've reached another step in our social and societal evolutions. </p>
